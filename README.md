# ArtStart
## About:
ArtStart is a virtual trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art! Emulating a real trip to the Met, users are presented with a randomized selection of the Met's collection upon every refresh. The selection of random works of art can be narrowed down by department as well as by searching for a particular artist. Users can click on each work of art to learn more about it such as when and where it was made, the medium(s) used, the size, and artist information. 

Created for Flatiron School's Phase 5 project, ArtStart's client-side application was built using React and Redux with a Rails API backend handling the fetching of data from the Met Museum's API.
